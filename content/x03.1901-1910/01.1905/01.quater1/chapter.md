#### RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND HEALTH AND TEMPERANCE

### FOR SENIOR CLASSES FIRST QUARTER, 1905

General Note. â€” It has been over nine years now since we had a series of lessons bearing directly on religious liberty. Those who were children only ten or twelve years old then are now young men and women. In view of this, and of the rapid developments that are being made in the movement to restrict religious liberty, which call for intelligent, active, and aggressive counter efforts on our part, it seems highly proper that a few lessons should again be devoted to this subject.
